# datascience2019 - coding assignment


Thanks for taking the time to solve this coding assignment. We really appreciate your effort!

We most often work in python so we ask that you also solve the problems in python. We provide the `python_env.yml` in the repository to create a reproducable environment. To install and active the environment, please run

`conda env create -n python_env -f python_env.yml`

`conda activate python_env`

in the terminal.

Feel free to add new packages to the environment if you use something that's not in the yaml file. If you prefer to use other tools to create a reproducable coding environment (e.g., docker, pip freeze), please give us instructions on how we can run your code. 

The two problems are described in `assignment.ipynb`.

Please push your final solution to the repo 48 hours after clicking on the github classroom link.
