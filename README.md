The `python_env.yml` is provided in the repository to create a reproducable environment. To install and active the environment, please run

`conda env create -n python_env -f python_env.yml`

`conda activate python_env`

in the terminal.

Feel free to add new packages to the environment if you use something that's not in the yaml file. If you prefer to use other tools to create a reproducable coding environment (e.g., docker, pip freeze), please give us instructions on how we can run your code. 

The two problems are described in `assignment.ipynb`.
